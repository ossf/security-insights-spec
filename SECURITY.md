# Reporting Security Issues

To report a security issue or vulnerability, submit a [private vulnerability report via GitHub](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/security/advisories/new) to the repository maintainers with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

Our vulnerability management team will respond within 7 working days of your report. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory and acknowledge your contributions as part of it. This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
